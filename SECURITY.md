# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security@yourcompany.com]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow up to 48 hours for initial response

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Management
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Rotate API keys regularly (recommended: every 90 days)
- Use different keys for different environments

### Network Security
- Always use HTTPS/WSS in production
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Use VPN for administrative access
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns

### Access Control
- Implement authentication for admin endpoints
- Use principle of least privilege
- Regularly audit access permissions
- Enable logging for all administrative actions

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use TLS 1.2+ for data in transit
- Implement proper session management
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Known Security Considerations

### Audio Data
- Audio streams are processed in memory only
- No persistent storage of conversation data
- Consider implementing audio encryption for sensitive use cases

### WebSocket Connections
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate all incoming WebSocket messages
- Use connection timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion

### Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Use tools like `pip-audit` to scan for known vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions in production

## Compliance

This framework is designed to support compliance with:
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- SOC 2 Type II requirements
- HIPAA (with additional configuration)
